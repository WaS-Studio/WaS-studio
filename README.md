can you gen some mock briefs for 3 projects that incorporate all of these so I can use it to develop these skills and technologies? dont worry about wordpress projects for now, i want to use react/typescript, graphql, docker/aws and could i use the next framework or sveltekit to handle state, or should i use a 3rd party library? anyway it would be great if the projects also be able to learn conversion optomization and funnel optomization

Here are three mock project briefs that incorporate the skills and technologies you mentioned. These projects will help you develop proficiency in React/TypeScript, GraphQL, Docker/AWS, Next.js/SvelteKit, and conversion/funnel optimization.

    E-commerce Platform
        Objective: Build an e-commerce platform for a small online store that sells gaming merchandise.
        Features:
            Product catalog with categories, filtering, and search
            Shopping cart and checkout process with Stripe or PayPal integration
            User authentication and profile management
            Admin dashboard for managing products and orders
        Technologies: React/TypeScript, GraphQL (Apollo or Relay), Next.js or SvelteKit, Docker/AWS
        Conversion/Funnel optimization: Implement A/B testing for product pages and checkout flow, analyze user behavior, and optimize the conversion funnel.

    Event Management Platform
        Objective: Create an event management platform for hosting and attending virtual gaming tournaments and conferences.
        Features:
            Event listing with search and filtering
            Event creation and management for organizers
            User registration, authentication, and profile management
            Payment processing for paid events
            Calendar integration for tracking upcoming events
        Technologies: React/TypeScript, GraphQL (Apollo or Relay), Next.js or SvelteKit, Docker/AWS
        Conversion/Funnel optimization: Optimize event registration flow, experiment with event listing layouts, and improve user onboarding.

    Online Learning Platform for Gamers
        Objective: Develop an online learning platform for gamers that offers video tutorials, articles, and quizzes to help them improve their skills.
        Features:
            Content library with categories, search, and filtering
            User authentication and profile management
            Progress tracking and personalized recommendations
            Gamification elements like points, badges, and leaderboards
            In-app messaging and community forum
        Technologies: React/TypeScript, GraphQL (Apollo or Relay), Next.js or SvelteKit, Docker/AWS
        Conversion/Funnel optimization: Experiment with different onboarding flows, optimize the user journey for content consumption, and enhance the overall user experience to increase engagement.

As for state management, both Next.js and SvelteKit come with built-in state management solutions. However, you can also use a third-party library like Redux, MobX, or Apollo Client if you want more advanced features or prefer a different approach.

By building these projects, you'll not only gain experience in the relevant technologies but also learn how to apply conversion and funnel optimization techniques to improve user experience and engagement.
